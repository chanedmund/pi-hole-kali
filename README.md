# pi-hole-kali
Altered basic-install.sh specifically for Kali Linux

Things you need to consider before running this file:
- I did not create this installer
- I simply edited it so that it would work with "unsuported" Kali Linux
- You MUST ALREADY have a static IP or static DHCP reservation for your pi-hole server
- You can probably only use the pi-hole as a DNS server instead of DHCP server, which is how it works best anyway.

Download basic-install.sh however you want.
I would advise that you read over it before you install it.
`sudo bash basic-install.sh`
